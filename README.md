## Usage
Head to the deployed link: 

Create an account on MooJournal or login to an exisiting account.

Then feel free to create new journal entries. Begin by indicating your current mood using the bar labeled 'How do you feel today?' and then proceed by clicking 'Continue'. Once your mood is submitted, you have the option to either receive a prompt or engage in a free write entry. If you opt for a prompt, you can select either 'light' or 'heavy' based on the depth of exploration desired. Should the generated prompt not align with your preferences, you also have the choice to generate a new one. Once you are content with the journal entry you have made click 'submit'.

All of the journal entries made can be viewed on your 'My MooJournal' Dashboard. From this page you can also write additional entries and 'Check your Charts' which allows you to see graph data of your logged mood entries.
